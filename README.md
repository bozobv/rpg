RPG game development for Android platform using libGDX framework

thesis work


Nowadays, the mobile phone has taken the lead in the video game market over the other platforms. Role-playing games dominate among the highest-income genres. The question arises as to why this is the case, as well as the need to develop a similarly popular role-playing game.

The dissertation goes through the characteristics of this genre, maps out what players think of it and why they love it, and then examines the commonalities of the biggest titles. In addition, it introduces a game development framework that supports the popular mobilephone platform, libGDX.

Based on the lessons learned from all this, a simpler action role-playing game with a two-dimensional, isometric appearance is designed, the main principle of which is easy to expand, and a great emphasis is placed on the efficient outsourcing of the objects that handle the display. The operation of each of its elements will be described in detail.

In conclusion, a summary is provided describing the results achieved and the opportunities for improvement.
